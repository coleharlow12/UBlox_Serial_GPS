# UBlox_Serial_GPS
The purpose of this repository is to be used with the Ublox 6m GPS. This GPS protocol is based on sending the messages directly as binary data rather than using NMEA strings and converting the messages to binary data. This makes communuciations with the UBlox through this method extremely fast. To understand how these messages are structed see the link to the UBlox manual below.
